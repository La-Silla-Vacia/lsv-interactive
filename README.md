Core Time Interactive files
====

Time.com interactives are compiled using [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and bootstrapped onto a page with a Wordpress short code.

The scripts are written as Node.js modules and compiled using the browserify command line tool.

=== time-interactive
Basic setup for the interactive. Adds the main CSS file. Depends only on jQuery.
